    <h1><center>The Deep Ocean</h1>
      <p><h6>Most people familiar with the oceans know about life only in the intertidal zone, where the water meets land, and the epipelagic zone, the upper sunlit zone of the open ocean. Though these zones contain an abundance of ocean life because sunlight is available for photosynthesis, they make up only a small fraction of the ocean biome. In fact, most of the ocean is cold, dark and deep. It is important to realize that photosynthesis occurs only down to about 100 - 200external link m, and sunlight disappears altogether at 1,000external link m or less, while the ocean descends to a maximum depth of about 11,000external link m in the Mariana Trench!</h6></p>
